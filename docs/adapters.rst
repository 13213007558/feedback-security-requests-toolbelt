Transport Adapters
==================

The toolbelt comes with several different transport adapters for you to use
with requests. The transport adapters are all kept in
:mod:`requests_toolbelt.adapters` and include

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.fingerprint.FingerprintAdapter`

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.socket_options.SocketOptionsAdapter`

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.socket_options.TCPKeepAliveAdapter`

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.source.SourceAddressAdapter`

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.ssl.SSLAdapter`

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.host_header_ssl.HostHeaderSSLAdapter`

- :class:`requests_toolbelt.adapters.x509.X509Adapter`

FingerprintAdapter
------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0

By default, requests will validate a server's certificate to ensure a
connection is secure. In addition to this, the user can provide a fingerprint
of the certificate they're expecting to receive. Unfortunately, the requests
API does not support this fairly rare use-case. When a user needs this extra
validation, they should use the
:class:`~requests_toolbelt.adapters.fingerprint.FingerprintAdapter` class to
perform the validation.

.. autoclass:: requests_toolbelt.adapters.fingerprint.FingerprintAdapter

SSLAdapter
----------

The ``SSLAdapter`` is the canonical implementation of the adapter proposed on
Cory Benfield's blog, `here`_. This adapter allows the user to choose one of
the SSL/TLS protocols made available in Python's ``ssl`` module for outgoing
HTTPS connections.

In principle, this shouldn't be necessary: compliant SSL servers should be able
to negotiate the required SSL version. In practice there have been bugs in some
versions of OpenSSL that mean that this negotiation doesn't go as planned. It
can be useful to be able to simply plug in a Transport Adapter that can paste
over the problem.

For example, suppose you're having difficulty with the server that provides TLS
for GitHub. You can work around it by using the following code::

    from requests_toolbelt.adapters.ssl import SSLAdapter

    import requests
    import ssl

    s = requests.Session()
    s.mount('https://github.com/', SSLAdapter(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1))

Any future requests to GitHub made through that adapter will automatically
attempt to negotiate TLSv1, and hopefully will succeed.

HostHeaderSSLAdapter
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.7.0

Requests supports SSL Verification by default. However, it relies on
the user making a request with the URL that has the hostname in it. If,
however, the user needs to make a request with the IP address, they cannot
actually verify a certificate against the hostname they want to request.
This adapter sets the `Server Name Indication`_ to, and verifies the
certificate against, the hostname in the Host header.

To accomodate this very rare need, we've added
:class:`~requests_toolbelt.adapters.host_header_ssl.HostHeaderSSLAdapter`.
Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

        import requests
        from requests_toolbelt.adapters import host_header_ssl
        s = requests.Session()
        s.mount('https://', host_header_ssl.HostHeaderSSLAdapter())
        s.get("https://93.184.216.34", headers={"Host": "example.org"})

.. autoclass:: requests_toolbelt.adapters.host_header_ssl.HostHeaderSSLAdapter

.. _Server Name Indication: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication

SourceAddressAdapter
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0

The :class:`~requests_toolbelt.adapters.source.SourceAddressAdapter` allows a
user to specify a source address for their connnection.

.. autoclass:: requests_toolbelt.adapters.source.SourceAddressAdapter

SocketOptionsAdapter
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0

.. note::

    This adapter will only work with requests 2.4.0 or newer. The ability to
    set arbitrary socket options does not exist prior to requests 2.4.0.

The ``SocketOptionsAdapter`` allows a user to pass specific options to be set
on created sockets when constructing the Adapter without subclassing. The
adapter takes advantage of ``urllib3``'s `support`_ for setting arbitrary
socket options for each ``urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`` (and
``HTTPSConnection``).

To pass socket options, you need to send a list of three-item tuples. For
example, ``requests`` and ``urllib3`` disable `Nagle's Algorithm`_ by default.
If you need to re-enable it, you would do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    import socket
    import requests
    from requests_toolbelt.adapters.socket_options import SocketOptionsAdapter

    nagles = [(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 0)]
    session = requests.Session()
    for scheme in session.adapters.keys():
        session.mount(scheme, SocketOptionsAdapter(socket_options=nagles))

This would re-enable Nagle's Algorithm for all ``http://`` and ``https://``
connections made with that session.

.. autoclass:: requests_toolbelt.adapters.socket_options.SocketOptionsAdapter

.. _support: https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pools.html?highlight=socket_options#urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection.socket_options
.. _Nagle's Algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm

TCPKeepAliveAdapter
-------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0

.. note::

    This adapter will only work with requests 2.4.0 or newer. The ability to
    set arbitrary socket options does not exist prior to requests 2.4.0.

The ``TCPKeepAliveAdapter`` allows a user to pass specific keep-alive related
options as keyword parameters as well as arbitrary socket options.

.. note::

    Different keep-alive related socket options may not be available for your
    platform. Check the socket module for the availability of the following
    constants:

    - ``socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE``
    - ``socket.TCP_KEEPCNT``
    - ``socket.TCP_KEEPINTVL``

    The adapter will silently ignore any option passed for a non-existent
    option.

An example usage of the adapter:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from requests_toolbelt.adapters.socket_options import TCPKeepAliveAdapter

    session = requests.Session()
    keep_alive = TCPKeepAliveAdapter(idle=120, count=20, interval=30)
    session.mount('https://region-a.geo-1.compute.hpcloudsvc.com', keep_alive)
    session.post('https://region-a.geo-1.compute.hpcloudsvc.com/v2/1234abcdef/servers',
                 # ...
                 )

In this case we know that creating a server on HP Public Cloud can cause
requests to hang without using TCP Keep-Alive. So we mount the adapter
specifically for that domain, instead of adding it to every ``https://`` and
``http://`` request.

.. autoclass:: requests_toolbelt.adapters.socket_options.TCPKeepAliveAdapter

X509Adapter
-----------

Requests supports SSL Verification using a certificate in .pem format by default.
In some cases it is necessary to pass a full cert chain as part of a request or it
is deemed too great a risk to decrypt the certificate into a .pem file.

For such use cases we have created
:class:`~requests_toolbelt.adapters.x509.X509Adapter`.
Example usage:

.. code-block:: python

      import requests
      from requests_toolbelt.adapters.x509 import X509Adapter
      s = requests.Session()
      a = X509Adapter(max_retries=3,
                      cert_bytes=b'...', pk_bytes=b'...')
      s.mount('https://', a)

The certificate (``cert_bytes``) and private key (``pk_bytes``) are passed as
in-memory byte arrays. Both PEM (the default) and DER encodings are accepted
via the ``encoding`` parameter, and encrypted private keys are supported by
passing ``password`` as a string or UTF-8 bytes. A bad passphrase or a
certificate/key pair that does not match raises while the adapter is being
constructed, before any request is sent.

.. note::

    Python's OpenSSL bindings only load a client cert chain from a file, so
    the in-memory material is briefly written to a ``0600`` temporary file
    and removed immediately after the ``ssl.SSLContext`` has loaded it. When
    the key is encrypted only the encrypted PEM is ever written; the
    passphrase itself is never stored.

Server certificate verification is left entirely to Requests and urllib3: the
session-level ``verify`` value and any per-request ``verify`` override (a
boolean or a path to a CA bundle) reach the underlying connection unchanged,
and hostname verification stays enabled whenever the peer certificate is
verified. A fresh ``ssl.SSLContext`` is created for every connection pool, so
switching between trusted bundles or ``verify=False`` for individual requests
cannot leak trust or verification state between requests.

When a proxy is used, trust for the proxy connection and trust for the
tunnelled target site are configured independently. For an HTTPS proxy,
urllib3's ``proxy_ssl_context`` governs the TLS connection to the proxy while
the adapter's context (and the request's ``verify``) governs the inner TLS
connection to the target; an untrusted proxy certificate therefore fails
before the tunnel is established, while an untrusted target certificate fails
afterwards.

.. note::

    The adapter requires Requests 2.12.0 or newer together with a urllib3
    release that uses the standard library ``ssl.SSLContext`` (urllib3
    1.26.x or 2.x). The pyOpenSSL-based context used by older releases is no
    longer supported because urllib3 2.x removed its pyOpenSSL integration.

Supported version combinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The adapter is driven by integration capabilities rather than a single
pinned release; the following combinations are covered by the test suite:

==========================  =====================  =========================
Requests                    urllib3                TLS implementation
==========================  =====================  =========================
2.12.x – 2.31.x             1.26.x                 stdlib ``ssl.SSLContext``
2.32.x and newer            2.x (e.g. 2.8)         stdlib ``ssl.SSLContext``
==========================  =====================  =========================

The currently exercised stack is Python 3.12 with Requests 2.34, urllib3 2.8
and a recent ``cryptography`` release. Python 2.7 / Requests older than
2.12 raise :class:`requests_toolbelt.exceptions.VersionMismatchError`, as do
environments without ``ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain``.
